# Overview
## Description of Program
This program takes a formatted input file, processes the text, and displays the data in a meaningful way.
## How to Run
To run the program, you must first have python installed. Run `python3 [path to the .py file] [path to the data file]` in a terminal to get the program started.
## Strengths/Weaknesses of Text Processing in Python
Python makes regular expressions fairly simple to compose and understand, as I had never done it before writing this program, and I thought it was easy to follow. One thing I struggled with was remembering that I needed to store the results of string manipulations into new variables, as strings are immutable. However, this was an easy fix as I got used to it.
## What I Learned
I learned how to compose a regular expression in Python, as well as how to manipulate strings in lists. Writing this program was also a great review on how classes and dictionaries can be used.
